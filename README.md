# Motion-Detection

## Intro
This is a quick prototype of motion detection from videos. The pipeline downloads videos and feeds them to the ML model to make predictions. This is an initial attempt to try out a new user study tool for urban space research.

## Setup
The script was previously developed inside Google Colab. Please follow the instructions within the file step by step, and all the necessary libraries and datasets will be installed along the way. It is also suggested to run the script on your Colab since the ML models might take some time to set up for the first time.

## Future Steps
The script is in development to further quantify user behavioral patterns in public spaces, enabling designers to devise urban strategies. Additionally, by importing different weights, stage design and scene design can also become potential applications of the pipeline.
