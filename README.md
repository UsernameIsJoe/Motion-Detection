# Motion-Detection

## Intro
This is a quick prototype of motion detection from videos. The pipeline downloads videos and feeds them to the ML model to make predictions. This is an initial attempt to try out a new user study tool for urban space research.

## Setup
The script was originally developed in Colab. Follow the steps in the script, and all necessary libraries and data will be downloaded.

## Future Steps
The script is in development to further quantify user behavioral patterns in public spaces, enabling designers to devise urban strategies. Additionally, by importing different weights, stage design and scene design can also become potential applications of the pipeline.
